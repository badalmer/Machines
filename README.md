# Painting-Plotter
A plotting machine designed to replicate vector paths using [LightBurn](https://lightburnsoftware.com/). A CNC system loosely based on the [ACRO system](https://openbuilds.com/builds/openbuilds-acro-system.5416/) from OpenBuilds. The machine is 
powered by an Arduino with a GRBL Shield.
